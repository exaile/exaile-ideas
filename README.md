# exaile-ideas
Repository that holds ideas for Exaile submitted by users.

We love our users, but some ideas would take a lot of effort to implement, and
for one reason or another nobody has stepped up to take the time to implement
the requested feature.

We don't want to lose the ideas completely, so we are now transferring them to
this repo, so that the main repo's issues are easier to navigate and prioritize.
